        <p class="TimeText2">The best time to visit Rome, Italy is during the spring (April to May) and autumn (September to October)—when the weather is pleasant with average temperatures between 15°C and 25°C (59°F and 77°F). During these months, you'll avoid the sweltering heat and humidity of summer while still  enjoying plenty of sunshine. Additionally, crowds are smaller during this time, so you'll have a more relaxed and enjoyable experience. If you're on a budget, consider visiting Rome in winter (November to March) when prices for flights and accommodations are at their lowest. However, be prepared for cooler temperatures and the possibility of rain.</p>
