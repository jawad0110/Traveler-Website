    <div class="Paristext">Paris, I'm in love! I ticked off the Eiffel Tower, Louvre, and more. The Champs-Élysées was chic, Montmartre was bohemian, and Saint-Germain was elegant. I embraced the Parisian way of life, from croissants to café culture. Paris, you're enchanting! I can't wait to come back!</div>

    <div class="Switzerlandtext2">Switzerland, wow! It was like stepping into a postcard. I mean, the Swiss Alps? They looked like they were straight out of a painting. Lake Geneva was so blue and clear, I could see all the way down to the bottom. Lucerne was like a fairy-tale town, with its cobblestone streets and colorful houses. And Zurich was so clean and modern, with a vibe that was totally unique. Switzerland, you totally blew my mind!</div>

    <div class="Tajahaltext">Taj Mahal, India</div>
    <div class="Indiatext">The Taj Mahal, man! It was incredible. The white marble was glowing, and the carvings were unreal. It felt like I was in a different world. Then I went inside, and the main chamber was even more mind-blowing. It was like a palace fit for a king. The Taj Mahal is seriously one of the best places I've ever been.</div>

  <div class="London">
    <div class="Londonrectangle"></div>
    <div class="Londontext">London rocks! I hit up Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, and more. The Tower of London was history heaven, and Covent Garden was electric. I chowed down at Borough Market and chilled in Hyde Park. London's non-stop energy was unreal! Can't wait to go back!</div>
